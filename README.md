# bayesian_data_analysis
[_"Bayesian data analysis is an increasingly popular method of statistical inference, used to determine conditional probability without having to rely on fixed constants such as confidence levels or p-values."_](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/bayesian-data-analysis-in-python) In this project, I’ll learn how Bayesian data analysis works, how it differs from the classical approach, and why it’s an indispensable part of a data science toolbox. 

These project is based on two DataCamp courses: [Introduction to Statistics in Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-statistics-in-python) and [Bayesian Data Analysis in Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/bayesian-data-analysis-in-python). The execution of the two parts will be conducted via two seperate Jupyter notebooks. 

## 1. Introduction to Statistics in Python
_"Statistics is the study of how to collect, analyze, and draw conclusions from data. It’s a hugely valuable tool that you can use to bring the future into focus and infer the answer to tons of questions"._ The datasets for this part were downloaded from the following [link](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-statistics-in-python): Food Consumption, 2019 World Happiness Report, and  Amir's sales deals.  Alternatively, the data can be downloaded from the following [repo](https://github.com/goodboychan/goodboychan.github.io/tree/main/_notebooks/dataset).
